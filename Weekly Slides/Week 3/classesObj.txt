1. System can be broken down to classes and classes can be reused and contains objects
think classes as designs and object as artifacts made in that design

2. Object is an instance of particular class and Creating an object is called INSTANTIATION

3. A primitive variable contains the value itself, but an object variable contains the address of the object

4. Two or more references that refer to the same object are called ALIASES of each other
Changing an object through one reference changes it for all of its aliases, because there is really only one object

5. Java performs automatic garbage collection periodically, returning an object's memory to the system for future use
In other languages, the programmer is responsible for performing garbage collection

6. we say that an object of the String class is immutable.. but with many method it can be manipulated version of the orginal

7. A class library is a collection of classes that we can use when developing programs
The Java standard class library is part of any Java development environment
