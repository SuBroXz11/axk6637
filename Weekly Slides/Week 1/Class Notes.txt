1. If we make "String"; randomly in the program.. It's called an object;

2. final key word is used to make constants.
	e.g final int hello = 22;

3. Scanner class is in util.java.

4. all the things we are using such as public static main etc all are in java.lang* package.

5. It is good to make different scanner class for the string and numeric.
